## **Folder Structure**
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the folder structure:

```
/app
  /electronics
    /[id]
      page.js         # Product details for each electronic item
    page.js           # Electronics page
  /fashion
    /[id]
      page.js         # Product details for fashion items

## **Authentication**
We use Firebase for authentication. To sign up or sign in, users can:
- Use their email and password.
- Sign in with their Google account via Firebase Authentication.

Once logged in, the `Logout` button appears, replacing the `Sign up/Sign in` option. The user's session is maintained using Firebase's session management.
